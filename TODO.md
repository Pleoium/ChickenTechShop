# TODO list

Put stuff I need to do here

Chicken Contact:
    - Chicken is a contact that gives out basic missions that give rewards, similar to other trade/underworld contacts

Chicken Special Missions/Contracts:
    - Low priority atm, but want to have special missions for unlocking blueprints of factions etc

Tech Market Level:
    - Tech Market is tied to a "Market Level" values
    - From level 1 to level 5
    - Each gives 20% more inventory options, where 100% means every special item is stocked
    - Market level is based on how much Chicken likes you + the monetary amount of contracts you have done for him
    - You can give him money to increase the market level instantly
