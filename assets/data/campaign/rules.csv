""Sit down."" a raspy voice speaks beneath the heavy hardsuit sitting in front of you. ""I've heard of you Captain, you've been making yourself known to the sector. I have a proposition for you.""

He pulls a bag from underneath the desk and lifts it onto the table, clattering some of his equipment in the process. He pauses and looks around for a moment, before pulling out a small holo-projector and setting it onto the table. With a swift click, it activates, creating a flimsy privacy barrier around both of you. 

""Privacy. Now, where is it? I know it's in here..."" he begins to pull out rusty and dirty eletrical and prefab components out of his bag, tossing them onto the steadily growing pile of junk to his side. He then reaches forward and pulls out a no-descript black box, with a simple clasp on the front.

""Here, take a look"" he pushes the box towards you and points at the latch.",CTS_MeetChickenIntro_2:Open the box,

""I would have given you an Alpha core, but I dont have any, not yet anyway."" He closes the box and pushes it towards you. ""Consider it a gift for our ongoing relationship""

""I am in the market for technology, I have an array of contacts across the sector that can get me - and therefore you, access to all the domain tech you need. This includes AI cores, Colony items, Blueprints and more. If you have the time, helping me with the occasional request would let me increase the selection available to you"".

""Just tap, we'll talk again soon"" He puts down his Tri-pad onto the table, and without further ado begins to stuff his pile of scrap back into his bags. You tap your pad to his, and one ping later have his details recorded for your use.

As Chicken stands up, he closes the privacy field and gives you a quick Hegemony style salute, ""See you around Captain, remember to check in every now and then"" he pauses for a moment, then points at the Beta box and adds ""Dont let that Beta get you down, he's been rude to everyone so far"".
